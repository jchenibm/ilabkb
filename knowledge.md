This week during Red Hat Summit, Red Hat announced a new chapter in its AI strategy: open sourcing select IBM Granite generative AI models and the model alignment tool InstructLab, which will both be part of the newly introduced Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) AI.

These announcements will benefit all watsonx customers and partners, drive open source community engagement around the Granite models and increase market and technical awareness for Red Hat and IBM's strategic differentiation in generative AI.

Catch up on some of the latest news from Red Hat Summit ↷

## 1. Introducing Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI

RHEL AI is a new foundation model runtime inferencing engine that enables users to more seamlessly develop, test and deploy generative AI models. With RHEL AI, Red Hat has the opportunity to do for Granite what it did for Linux with RHEL.

RHEL AI will be integrated into Red Hat OpenShift AI, which is the underlying hybrid MLOps platform that watsonx.ai is built on. The new RHEL AI runtime includes:

- Select open source Granite language and code models fully supported and indemnified by Red Hat and IBM
- Supported distribution of InstructLab
- Red Hat's complete enterprise support and lifecycle promise
